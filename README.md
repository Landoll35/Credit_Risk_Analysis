# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Since credit risk is an issue that is sometimes hard to predict, the models in this project aim to project which loans are more likely to be good loans vs. bad. Oversampling and undersampling algorithms, as well as a combination approach will help show which method is most effective in predicting risk. After the algorithms are calculated, we will compare two machine learning models that reduce bias and wil evaluate which machine learning model is best used in predicting risk.

- The balanced accuracy score is about 79% with the high rish precision at 3% with 70% sensitivity

- The balanced accuracy score is about 66% with the high rish precision at 1% with 69% sensitivity

## Summary
The only model that performed even close to accurate was the Easy Ensemble Classifier at 93%. If banks were to use any of these models, that would be the one that I strongly reccommend, although I would definitely look into other models that may be even more accurate than that.
